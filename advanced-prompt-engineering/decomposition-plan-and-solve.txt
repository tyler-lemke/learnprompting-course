Instructions
Preheat oven to 350F (175C) and spray a 9×13 glass baking dish with baking spray. Set aside.
Place egg whites in a large bowl or in the bowl of a stand mixer and use an electric mixer or your stand mixer’s whisk attachment to beat until foamy. Gradually increase mixer speed to medium-high and add just 1 cup (200g) of sugar, adding about 2 Tablespoons at a time and allowing about 10 seconds after each addition. Increase mixer speed to high and beat until egg white mixture is thick and glossy and you achieve stiff peaks¹ (much like you are making a meringue).
5 large eggs,2 cups (400 g) granulated sugar
If you used a stand mixer, scoop egg whites into a separate clean bowl and set aside and carry on using the same bowl for the next step (no need to clean the bowl). If you used an electric hand mixer, just grab a new bowl at this point.


I have this recipe but I need to make it for people who have the following food allergies:
Wheat,
Egg,
milk

First try to understand the problem. Then devise a plan to solve the problem.
Finally break the problem into its component steps.


Response:

To make a tres leches cake that’s safe for people with wheat, egg, and milk allergies, let’s analyze and plan. The original recipe contains several ingredients that need to be substituted due to the allergies. Here’s how we’ll approach it:

### Understanding the Problem
The main components that need substitutes are:
1. **Wheat:** Present in all-purpose flour.
2. **Eggs:** Found in the cake batter.
3. **Milk:** Found in the milk, condensed milk, evaporated milk, and heavy cream components.

Since wheat, eggs, and milk are key to the texture and flavor of traditional tres leches cake, we’ll need to find alternatives that provide a similar experience.

### Plan to Modify the Recipe
We’ll break down the recipe into three parts (cake, leches topping, and whipped cream) and find substitutions for each of the allergenic ingredients. Here’s the approach:

1. **Cake Base:** Replace all-purpose flour (wheat) with a gluten-free flour blend. Substitute eggs with a vegan-friendly option that mimics their binding and leavening functions. Use a plant-based milk to replace regular milk.
2. **Leches Topping:** Replace the sweetened condensed milk, evaporated milk, and heavy cream with dairy-free alternatives that still provide richness and sweetness.
3. **Whipped Cream Topping:** Use a dairy-free whipping cream to create a fluffy, creamy topping.

### Breaking Down the Solution into Subproblems

#### Step 1: Substitute the Cake Base
1. **Replace All-Purpose Flour** (250 g) with a **gluten-free flour blend** (many are designed to be direct substitutes for regular flour).
2. **Replace Eggs** (5 large eggs) with a combination of egg replacers. Options include:
   - **Applesauce or mashed banana** (¼ cup per egg).
   - **Aquafaba** (the liquid from a can of chickpeas), which can be whipped similarly to egg whites.
   - **Commercial egg replacer** (follow the instructions on the package).
3. **Replace Milk** (1 cup/235 ml) with **dairy-free milk** (like almond, oat, or soy milk).

#### Step 2: Substitute the Leches Topping
1. **Replace Sweetened Condensed Milk** (14 oz) with **coconut condensed milk** or **homemade dairy-free condensed milk** (combine coconut milk with sugar and cook until thickened).
2. **Replace Evaporated Milk** (12 oz) with **coconut milk** or **another thick dairy-free milk**.
3. **Replace Heavy Cream** (½ cup) with **coconut cream** or a thick plant-based cream.

#### Step 3: Substitute the Whipped Cream
1. **Replace Heavy Cream** (1½ cups) with **dairy-free whipping cream** (such as coconut cream or a ready-made plant-based whipping cream).
2. **Replace Powdered Sugar** with a small amount of powdered sugar, as it typically doesn’t contain dairy.
3. **Ground Cinnamon** can remain the same, as it’s safe for the dietary restrictions.

### Rewritten Recipe with Substitutions

#### Ingredients
- **Cake Base:**
  - 2 cups (250 g) gluten-free flour blend
  - Egg substitute for 5 eggs (see options above)
  - 1 cup (235 ml) dairy-free milk
  - ½ cup (113 g) plant-based butter, softened
  - 2 cups (400 g) granulated sugar, divided
  - 1½ tsp vanilla extract
  - 2 tsp baking powder
  - 1 tsp salt

- **Leches Topping:**
  - 14 oz (397 g) coconut condensed milk or homemade dairy-free condensed milk
  - 12 oz (340 g) coconut milk or another dairy-free milk
  - ½ cup (118 ml) coconut cream or other plant-based cream
  - ½ tsp vanilla extract

- **Whipped Cream:**
  - 1½ cups (355 ml) dairy-free whipping cream (like coconut cream)
  - ½ cup (65 g) powdered sugar
  - ½ tsp vanilla extract
  - Ground cinnamon for sprinkling (optional)

### Instructions
1. **Preheat Oven**: Preheat to 350°F (175°C) and grease a 9×13 baking dish.
  
2. **Make the Cake Base**: Whip the egg substitute (e.g., aquafaba if using) until it forms stiff peaks, then gradually add 1 cup of sugar. Separately, cream the plant-based butter with the remaining sugar. Combine flour, baking powder, and salt. Gradually fold in the flour mixture and dairy-free milk. Pour batter into the prepared dish and bake for 25–30 minutes.

3. **Prepare Leches Topping**: Mix the coconut condensed milk, coconut milk, coconut cream, and vanilla extract. Once the cake has cooled, poke holes in the top and pour the leches mixture over it.

4. **Prepare Whipped Cream**: Whip the dairy-free whipping cream with powdered sugar and vanilla until fluffy. Spread over the cake, sprinkle with cinnamon if desired, and serve chilled.

This adaptation should create a delicious, allergen-free tres leches cake while maintaining the essential flavors and textures of the traditional dessert. Enjoy!
