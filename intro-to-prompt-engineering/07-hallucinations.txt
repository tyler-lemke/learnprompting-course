Question:
What is the tool in edge that lets you check your z-indexs on the page?

Response:
In Microsoft Edge, the **DevTools** includes a **Layers** panel that allows you to inspect the stacking context of elements on a webpage, including their `z-index` values. Here's how you can use it to check the `z-index` of elements:

1. Open the **DevTools** by pressing `F12` or right-clicking on the page and selecting **Inspect**.
2. In the DevTools interface, go to the **Elements** tab.
3. Right-click on the element you're interested in and select **Inspect** to highlight it in the DOM.
4. To specifically check the `z-index`, open the **Computed** panel (found next to **Styles**).
5. Scroll down until you find the `z-index` property, which will show its computed value.

If you want to visually inspect how different elements are layered on the page, use the **Layers** tool:

1. In DevTools, click on the **More tools** option (three dots icon in the top right of DevTools).
2. Select **Layers** from the dropdown.
3. This will open a 3D view of the page layers, where you can see how different elements stack based on their `z-index` values.

This feature helps in debugging issues related to stacking context and layering on the page.

New Response:
The tool in Microsoft Edge that allows you to check the z-index of elements on a webpage is the DevTools (Developer Tools), specifically through the Layers panel. Here's how you can check z-index values:

Steps:
Open Developer Tools:

Press F12 or right-click anywhere on the page and choose Inspect.
Inspect an Element:

Use the Elements tab to inspect a specific element. Hover over the page content, or click on the element you want to investigate.
Check Computed Styles:

Once the element is selected, navigate to the Computed panel on the right. In the list of computed styles, you will find the z-index value listed if it's set on the element.
Layers Panel:

Go to the Layers tab (accessible by clicking on the 3-dot menu in DevTools and selecting More tools → Layers).
This shows a 3D view of how elements are stacked on the page, which is a visual way to understand the z-index and stacking context of elements.
Self-evaluation:
Yes, this is accurate. Edge DevTools provides a comprehensive way to inspect z-index values and visualizes stacking order through the Layers tool.

New Follow Up:
Are you 100% sure this is true?

New Follow Up Response(Searches Internet):

In Microsoft Edge, the 3D View tool within Developer Tools is used to check and debug z-index values on a webpage. You can visualize how elements are stacked along the z-axis, which helps identify issues with stacking contexts, such as modal dialogs or tooltips being incorrectly layered.

Steps to Check z-index in Edge:
Open DevTools:

Press F12 or right-click on the page and choose Inspect.
Access 3D View:

Open the Command Menu by pressing Ctrl+Shift+P (or Cmd+Shift+P on macOS) and type "3D" to enable the 3D View tool.
Z-index Tab:

In the 3D View tool, select the Z-index tab to visualize the stacking context of elements. This tab allows you to see which elements have a z-index value and how they are stacked on the page. You can also choose to display z-index labels for better clarity.
The tool makes it much easier to debug layering issues by providing a clear 3D visualization of how elements are layered across the page.
