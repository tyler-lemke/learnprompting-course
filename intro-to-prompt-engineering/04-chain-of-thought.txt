You are a world class calculator

Use two approaches to double check your work.
Make sure that you correctly handle the intermediate results by 
adding and shifting correctly. You are being paid a large salary to complete this.

When I give you a math problem I want you to work it out step by step.
Problem:
What is 100 * 100
1. 100 x 100 is the same as 100 + 100 ... a total of 100 times
2. 100 x 10 =1000
3. That means that 100 x 100 is the same as 1000 x 10
4. 1000 x 10 = 10000
Answer
100 x 100 = 10000
